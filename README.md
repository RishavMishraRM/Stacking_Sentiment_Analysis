# Stacking_Sentiment_Analysis <br>
Twitter is a social media site, where people interact with the other users by posting messages called tweets, about topics they include in their posts using hashtags. Twitter is a rich source of data. Analyzing the tweets can give you important and interesting insights about what people are talking about, the sentiments of people, their opinions towards a particular topic/brand and the general trends in society.
Sentiment analysis refers to analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data like text or images, regarding almost anything. Sentiment analysis helps companies in their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment towards a product is not so good, a company may try to modify the product or stop the production altogether in order to avoid any losses.
