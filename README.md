# Stacking_Sentiment_Analysis <br>
Twitter is a social media site, where people interact with the other users by posting messages called tweets, about topics they include in their posts using hashtags. Twitter is a rich source of data. Analyzing the tweets can give you important and interesting insights about what people are talking about, the sentiments of people, their opinions towards a particular topic/brand and the general trends in society. <br> <br>
Sentiment analysis refers to analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data like text or images, regarding almost anything. Sentiment analysis helps companies in their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment towards a product is not so good, a company may try to modify the product or stop the production altogether in order to avoid any losses.<br> <br>

Text preprocessing steps include a few essential tasks to further clean the available text data. It includes tasks like:-
<br> <br>
1. Stop-Word Removal : In English words like a, an, the, as, in, on, etc. are considered as stop-words so according to our requirements we can remove them to reduce vocabulary size as these words don't have some specific meaning<br>

2. Lower Casing : Convert all words into the lower case because the upper or lower case may not make a difference for the problem. And we are reducing vocabulary size by doing so. <br>

Stemming : Stemming refers to the process of removing suffixes and reducing a word to some base form such that all different variants of that word can be represented by the same form (e.g., “walk” and “walking” are both reduced to “walk”).

Tokenization : NLP software typically analyzes text by breaking it up into words (tokens) and sentences.
